# Practice Assignment Overview

This assignment is split into two parts.  
- **Part 1** will give you the opportunity to demonstrate your plotting and visualization skills.  
- **Part 2** is about creating and customizing dashboards.

## Part 1: Analyzing the Wildfire Activities in Australia

### **Data Description**
This wildfire dataset contains data on fire activities in Australia starting from 2005. Additional information can be found [here](#).  

The dataset includes the following variables:  
- **Region**: The 7 regions  
- **Date**: In UTC and provides data for 24 hours ahead  
- **Estimated_fire_area**: Daily sum of estimated fire area for presumed vegetation fires with a confidence > 75% for each region in kmÂ²  
- **Mean_estimated_fire_brightness**: Daily mean (by flagged fire pixels) of estimated fire brightness for presumed vegetation fires with a confidence > 75% in Kelvin  
- **Mean_estimated_fire_radiative_power**: Daily mean of estimated radiative power for presumed vegetation fires with a confidence > 75% for a given region in megawatts  
- **Mean_confidence**: Daily mean of confidence for presumed vegetation fires with a confidence > 75%  
- **Std_confidence**: Standard deviation of estimated fire radiative power in megawatts  
- **Var_confidence**: Variance of estimated fire radiative power in megawatts  
- **Count**: Daily number of pixels for presumed vegetation fires with a confidence > 75% for a given region  
- **Replaced**: Indicates with "Y" whether the data has been replaced with standard quality data when they are available (usually with a 2-3 month lag). Replaced data has slightly higher quality in terms of locations.

### **Objective**
The objective of this part is to analyze and visualize wildfire activities in Australia using the provided dataset. You will explore patterns and trends and create visualizations to gain insights into the behavior of wildfires across different regions.

### **Visualization Tools**
- **Matplotlib**  
- **Seaborn**  
- **Pandas**  
- **Folium**

### **Tasks to be Performed**
1. **TASK 1.1**: Use pandas to plot a line chart to understand the change in average estimated fire area over time.  
2. **TASK 1.2**: Plot the estimated fire area over the months.  
3. **TASK 1.3**: Use Seaborn to develop a bar plot and find insights on the distribution of mean estimated fire brightness across the regions.  
4. **TASK 1.4**: Create a pie chart to understand how the count of pixels for presumed vegetation fires varies across regions.  
5. **TASK 1.5**: Customize the previous pie chart for better visual representation.  
6. **TASK 1.6**: Use Matplotlib to develop a histogram of the mean estimated fire brightness.  
7. **TASK 1.7**: Use Seaborn and pass "Region" as the `hue` parameter to understand the distribution of estimated fire brightness across regions.  
8. **TASK 1.8**: Develop a scatter plot to find the correlation between mean estimated fire radiative power and mean confidence level.  
9. **TASK 1.9**: Mark all seven regions affected by wildfires on a map of Australia using Folium.

## Part 2: Dashboard to Display Charts Based on Selected Region and Year

### **Objective**
The objective of this part is to create dashboards to contain your plots and charts.  

You will use **Dash** and **Plotly** to:  
- Add user interactions to your dashboards.  
- Create a dashboard where users can select a **Region** and a **Year**.  
- Based on the selection, display:  
  - A **Pie Chart** for the Monthly Average Estimated Fire Area.  
  - A **Bar Chart** for the Monthly Average Count of Pixels for Presumed Vegetation Fires.

### **Tasks to be Performed**
1. **TASK 2.1**: Add a title to the dashboard.  
2. **TASK 2.2**: Add radio items and a dropdown right below the first inner division.  
3. **TASK 2.3**: Add two empty divisions for output inside the next inner division.  
4. **TASK 2.4**: Add the output and input components inside the `app.callback` decorator.  
5. **TASK 2.5**: Add the callback function.
